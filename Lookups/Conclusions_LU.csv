North Coast,"There were 10 monitoring stations within the North Coast AgWQ Management Area that had sufficient data to calculate status (7DADM) and evaluate against the applicable water quality standard. Only 1 of these 10 stations met the applicable standard, and the remaining 9 stations exceeded the standard. Data collected from 30   stations were sufficient to determine trends. Most stations (18) were degrading, 4 stations were improving, and 8 stations did not show a statistically significant trend for temperature.","Data collected at 16 stations were sufficient to evaluate status and/or trends of pH within the North Coast AgWQ Management Area. Only 3 monitoring stations (10817, 11434, and 12187) had exceedances of the water quality standard within the last two years. Trends at 12 of the 16 stations with sufficient data were degrading.","There were 15 monitoring stations within the North Coast AgWQ Management that had sufficient data to assess status and/or trends in E. coli concentration. One monitoring station (Station ID: 13440, Tillamook River at Bewley Creek Rd.) had at least one exceedance of the water quality standard within the last two years, but had a significant improving trend. Six monitoring stations (10523, 13417, 13421, 13424, 13433, 34019) do not have exceedances of the water quality standard within the last two years, but a significant degrading trend. The remaining 8 monitoring stations do not have exceedances of the water quality standard and do not exhibit significant trends within the last 15 years.","Data collected at 18 stations were sufficient to assess water quality status and/or trends in dissolved oxygen concentration. Dissolved oxygen concentrations observed at 10 stations exceeded the water quality standard within the last two years. Observed trends were mixed, with 8 stations improving, 1 station degrading, and the remaining 7 stations with no statistically significant trend.","Data collected at 16 stations were sufficient to evaluate status and/or trends in total phosphorous concentration within the North Coast AgWQ Management Area. Data collected at these stations did not exceed the water quality standard within the last 2 years. Only one statistically significant trend (station 10812, classified as “steady”) was observed.","Data collected at 16 stations were sufficient to evaluate status and/or trends in total suspended solids concentration within the North Coast AgWQ Management Area. Data collected at these stations did not exceed the water quality standard within the last 2 years. Trends were steady at 2 of these stations, and degrading at 5 stations.","Although total suspended solid concentrations were classified as degrading at 5 of 16 stations, observed concentrations at these stations were very low. Degrading trends at these stations were marginal (i.e., the slopes of these trend lines were close to 0). Although statistically significant, these trends are likely the result of having a high number of observations at these stations, rather than a meaningful lessening of water quality at these stations."
North Coast,,,,,,,"Continuous data are preferred when parameters fluctuate on a daily basis (e.g., temperature, DO, pH). However they were not always available for the analyses presented here, and are not necessary for making determinations regarding status or trends. "
North Coast,,,,,,,This report is best used as a summary and statistical analysis of the status and trends in water quality data collected throughout the North Coast AgWQ Management Area. Interpretation of results will require knowledge of local conditions known to affect the observed water quality conditions at individual sites.
