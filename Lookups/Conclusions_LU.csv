"Coos-Coquille","Ecoli","There were 10 monitoring stations within the Coos-Coquille AgWQ Management with data adequate to assess status and/or trends in E. coli concentration. Two monitoring stations (10393 and 11486) had at least one exceedance of the water quality standard within the last two years, but exhibited no significant trend. Seven stations were found to meet the E. coli standard within the last two years. Of these seven, one station was improving (13570) and two exhibited no significant trend (10596 and 13574). Four stations (33922, CTCLUSI_WQX-CTCEDWQ, CTCLUSI_WQX-CTCNSWQ, and CTCLUSI_WQX-CTCTDWQ) that met the standard did not have enough data to determine a trend. The remaining station (11485) had an undetermined status and exhibited no significant trend."
"Coos-Coquille","Entero","Data were not available in sufficient quantity to assess status and trends in Enterococcus concentration."
"Coos-Coquille","pH","Data collected at 10 stations were sufficient to evaluate pH status and/or trends within the Coos-Coquille Agricultural Water Quality Management Area. Data collected at three monitoring stations (10393, 13570, and 13574) met the water quality standard within the last two years but exhibited no significant trend. Data collected at one station (10596) met the standard and had a steady trend. One station (11486) met the standard but had a degrading trend. One station (33922) met the standard with an undetermined trend. Three stations (11485, 14018, and 34830) had an undetermined status, but showed a degrading trend; one last station (34829) had an undetermined status and no statistically significant trend."
"Coos-Coquille","Temp","Data were not available in sufficient quantity to assess status and trends in temperature."
"Coos-Coquille","TP","Data collected at nine stations were sufficient to evaluate trends in total phosphorous concentration. Three stations (10393, 10596, and 13574) had a statistically significant steady (flat) trend. The remaining six stations (11485, 11486, 13570, 14018, 34829, and 34830) exhibited no significant trend."
"Coos-Coquille","TSS","Data collected at six stations were sufficient to evaluate trends in total suspended solids. Three stations (10393, 11485, and 11486) had a statistically significant degrading trend. The remaining three stations (10596, 13570, and 13574) did not have a statistically significant trend."
"Coos-Coquille","Add_conc","Grab samples may not provide a complete characterization of water quality for parameters that fluctuate on a daily basis (e.g., DO and pH). For this reason continuous data are preferred and should be considered when monitoring these parameters in the future."
"Coos-Coquille","Add_conc","This report is best used as a summary and statistical analysis of the status and trends in water quality data collected throughout the Coos-Coquille AgWQ Management Area. Interpretation of results will require knowledge of local conditions known to affect the observed water quality conditions at individual sites."
"Coos-Coquille","Add_conc","Knowledge of local conditions is especially important in the interpretation of trends. Some real, meaningful trends may be obscured by a lack of statistical significance. Conversely, some other statistically significant trends are can be the result of having a high number of observations at these stations, rather than any meaningful change in water quality at these stations."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","DO","Concentrations at both stations exceeded the water quality standard within the last two years. An improving trend was observed at the John Day station, and no statistically significant trend was observed at the South Fork station."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","Ecoli","Concentrations at both stations exceeded the water quality standard within the last two years. A degrading trend was observed at the John Day station, and no statistically significant trend was observed at the South Fork station."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","Entero","Not applicable to this watershed."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","pH","Concentrations at both stations met the water quality standard within the last two years. No statistically significant trend was observed at the John Day station, and a steady (flat) trend was observed at the South Fork station."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","Temp","Data were not available in sufficient quantity to evaluate status or trends in temperature."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","TP","Data were not available in sufficient quantity to evaluate trends in total phosphorous concentration. Status was not evaluated because no standard for total phosphorous exists in these watersheds."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","TSS","Degrading trends (i.e., increasing TSS concentration) in were observed at both stations. Status was not evaluated because no standard for TSS exists in these watersheds."
"Upper Mainstem and South Fork John Day River","Add_conc","Grab samples may not provide a complete characterization of water quality for parameters that fluctuate on a daily basis (e.g., DO and pH).
