Monitoring station 11457 is does not have any exceedances of the water quality standard within the last two years of assessed data, while monitoring station 10410 has at least an exceedance of the water quality standard within the last two years."
Wallowa,pH,"There are two monitoring stations within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area that have sufficient data to assess water quality status and/or trends of pH in relation to the applicable Oregon water quality standards. Both statins meet the water quality standard within the last two years of assessed data. Monitoring station 11457 has a significant positive trend, monitoring station 10410 does not have a significant trend."
Wallowa,Temp,"There is one monitoring station within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area that has sufficient data to calculate the seven-day-average-daily maximum and assess the results in relation to the applicable water quality standard. The monitoring station, USGS-13331500, has exceedances of the water quality standard within the last two years of assessed data."
Wallowa,TP,There are two monitoring stations within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area that have sufficient data to assess total phosphorus trends. No total phosphorus TMDL load allocation exists within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area. Monitoring station 11457 has a significant steady trend (slope equals zero); monitoring station 10410 has an insignificant trend. Monitoring station 35825 has grab sample data within the last two years.
Wallowa,TSS, There are two monitoring stations within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area that have sufficient data to assess total suspended solids trends. No total suspended solid TMDL load allocation exists within the Wallowa AgWQ Management Area. Monitoring station 11457 has a significant steady trend (slope equals zero); monitoring station 10410 has an insignificant trend.
Yamhill,Add_conc,Monitoring stations with sufficient data to assess status and/or trends do not display spatial homogeneity within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area.
Yamhill,Add_conc,"No monitoring stations that fit the criteria to assess status and/or trends have continuous dissolved oxygen or pH data, which is useful to understand the diurnal fluctuations."
Yamhill,Add_conc,"All monitoring stations with total phosphorus data have exceedances of the TMDL load allocation, expressed in the 1992 Yamhill Subbasin TMDL."
Yamhill,Add_conc,"All five monitoring stations are located on larger streams. Four of the five stations exceeded the temperature status (last two years of available data). For the Middle Willamette, stations are not representative of the implementation statrigies identified in the Temperature TMDL for smaller streams."
Yamhill,DO,"Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of dissolved oxygen within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. None of the stations have continuous data and none display significant trends. All stations have exceedances of the water quality criteria within the last two years of data (2015-2017)."
Yamhill,Ecoli,"Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of E. coli within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. Stations 10363 and 10948 do not have enough data to calculate the geometric mean for determining water quality status during the entire timeframe (2000-2017). None of the monitoring stations had significant trends and all had at least one exceedance of the water quality criteria within the last two years of data (2015-2017)."
Yamhill,pH,"Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and/or trends of pH within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. The results for station 10363 have decreasing (degrading) trends and there are exceedances of the pH water quality criteria within the last two years (2015-2017) of data. Stations 10929 and 10948 do not have significant trends and do not have any exceedances of the water quality criteria during the last two years of data (2015-2017)."
Yamhill,Temp,"Four monitoring stations (USGS 14197900, USGS 14192015, 10363, and 10948) have sufficient data to calculate the temperature seven day average daily maximum (7DADM) and compare results to the water quality criteria within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. All monitoring stations have exceedances of the water quality criteria within the last two years of available data. None of the monitoring stations have significant trends. The USGS monitoring stations have continuous data."
Yamhill,TP,"Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess status and trends of total phosphorus within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. No monitoring stations had results that represented significant trends. All monitoring stations had consistent exceedances of the TMDL load allocation of 0.07 mg/l through the entire timeframe."
Yamhill,TSS,"Three monitoring stations (10363, 10929, and 10948) have sufficient data to assess trends of total suspended solids within the Yamhill AgWQ Management Area. Stations 10498 and 10929 had significant trends; station 10948 displays significant steady trends, while 10929 displays significant increasing (degrading) trends. Data was not compared to a TMDL load allocation since one has not been developed for the Middle Willamette or Yamill Subbasins."
