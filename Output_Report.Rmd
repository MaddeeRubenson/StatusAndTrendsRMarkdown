# Introduction

## Purpose

Area rules and plans have been adopted by the Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) for the `r input$select` Subbasin management area (`r OAR_LU[OAR_LU$AgArea %in% input$select,'OAR']`). Oregon statute and administrative rules require ODA to consult with the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) during the biennial review of Agricultural Water Quality Management Area Rules and Plans (ORS 568.930).  DEQ Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) and Nonpoint Source (NPS) program staff conduct these reviews based on ODA's biennial review schedule of their area rules and plans. ODA's Agriculture Water Quality Program is outcome based, explicitly describing prohibited conditions, similar to DEQ's TMDL and NPS programs which explicitly define water quality targets and goals.  The analysis of landscape conditions and water quality data is used for implementing these programs as well as identifying data gaps. 

The report presents data and analysis that will help DEQ fulfill its roles in the biennial review process described in the Memorandum of Agreement between ODA and DEQ. This water quality status and trends report can be used to inform discussions between DEQ Basin Coordinators and ODA Agriculture Water Quality Specialists prior to the Local Advisory Committee meeting. The discussions between DEQ and ODA prior to the LAC meeting could include: water quality and what's working and not working, source(s) and solutions, data needs and future monitoring to answer these questions. This report presents an analysis of water quality data readily accessible from public databases and available in sufficient quantity to indicate status and trends. Dependent on data availability, DEQ will use the available water quality data to answer the first three bullets and for the fourth bullet, the report is expected to inform DEQ Basin Coordinator analysis, interpretation, and discussion with ODA and the LAC about possible or potential sources:

*	What is the status of water quality parameters? 
*	What is the trend in water quality? 
*	When applicable, are TMDL load allocations for total phosphorus and total suspended solids being met?
* Can water quality status and trends be attributed to a source or sources?

DEQ basin coordinators review pertinent information including this report as part of ODA's biennial review. DEQ basin coordinators recommend changes and additional data and resources necessary to achieve water quality criterion and meet TMDL load allocations through ODA's survey.

<!-- ## Total Maximum Daily Load -->
<!-- A TMDL was created for ([Yamhill Subbasin](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/YamhillTMDL1992.pdf)) in 1992, identifying pH and total phosphorus pollutants of concern. The TMDL identifies a total phosphorus allocation of 70 ug/l (0.07 mg/l).  -->

# Methods

## Data Sources
Analysts retrieved data from [DEQ](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/wq/Pages/WQdata.aspx) (LASAR and ELEMENT), EPA ([Storet](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-data-wqx)) USGS ([NWIS](https://qwwebservices.usgs.gov/), [Water Quality Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/)) databases.A summary of all organizations that provided data that was queried and evaluated for use in this report is found in the Appendix. The time period for the query was from `r input$dates[1]` to `r input$dates[2]`. Parameters included in the query were temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, and bacteria. The data returned were evaluated for data quality. DEQ data included  `r unique(df.all[df.all$Database == 'Element' | df.all$Database == 'LASAR', 'Status'])` data determined following the [figs(name = "labManual", caption = "DEQ's Laboratory Quality Manual**")](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/DEQ91LAB0006QMP.pdf). EPA and USGS data were included unless result comments indicated problems with the data. Recent data (after June 2014) from the USGS was marked as provisional data and included in this analysis. 

## Decision Criteria

Status and long-term trends of the data were assessed for evaluating water quality in relation to water quality criterion or TMDL allocations. A decision criterion has been created for selecting stations that had greater than eight years of data and/or data to address water quality status. Monitoring data from tribal lands were not included in this analysis. Dominant land use characteristics were used as a station descriptor, not a deciding factor.

# Analysis

DEQ compared pH results from both grab and continuous sample data to the water quality criterion. The bacteria standard is based on the presence of E. coli compared to a single sample maximum and a geometric mean of five or more samples in a 90 day period. The temperature standard is based on the calculation of the seven day average of the daily maximum stream temperatures. When applicable, total suspended solids and total phosphorus were compared to the TMDL load allocation. If no allocation was present, total suspended solid and total phosphorus result values were plotted over time. Trends for pH, E. coli, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids were assessed using Seasonal Kendall Analysis, which removes the influence of season-to-season fluctuations .  The Seasonal Kendall Analysis also indicates the statistical significance and slope of the trend [Hirsch et al. 1982](https://profile.usgs.gov/myscience/upload_folder/ci2012Oct1508260828033Techniques%20of%20Trend%20Analysis%20for%20Monthly%20Water%20Quality%20Data.pdf). 

Dissolved oxygen (DO) was assessed by comparing the concentration to the water quality criterion. If the DO concentration exceeded the water quality criterion, but met the criteria for percent saturation at the same time, it was considered to be in compliance with the water quality criterion. These points were noted in the plots using a different color. Fish use and spawning maps  and the DO criteria flow chart  were used to determine the applicable temperature and DO standards for the spawning and non-spawning time periods. 

For temperature trend analysis, analysts used data only from stations with eight years of continuous hourly temperature data in each month during the query period. Data were not used if observations were missing for more than one day each month or if fewer than 22 hourly measurements were recorded during the day. These criteria resulted in no more than 10% missing data across each of the temporal periods of interest. Trends in the data were tested using a Mann Kendall test (Mann 1945). Trends were evaluated on the following metrics:

* Average Monthly 7-day average daily maximum
* Average Monthly daily degree hours > the applicable temperature standard. 

Trends are more detectable with the average monthly daily degree hours that exceed the applicable temperature standard because the metric incorporates both magnitude and duration of temperatures; the 7-day average daily maximum only incorporates the magnitude of exceedance. Fish use and spawning maps  were used to determine the applicable temperature standards for the spawning and non-spawning time periods. The results of this report includes graphs for stations with data that exceeded a water quality criterion more than once and/or showed a positive or negative trend. When insufficient data were available, that was noted in the graphs. 

# Results


## Station Locations

Within the `r input$select` AgWQ Management Area, `r length(unique(stns$Station_ID))` out of `r length(unique(df.all$Station_ID))` monitoring stations fit the criteria to assess water quality status and trends. The following map shows monitoring stations that fit the criteria within the watershed, all stations that were queried, and multiple background layer options.

## Land Use

Each monitoring station that fit the criteria to assess water quality status and/or trends was included in the land use analysis. The Stream-Catchment ([StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat)) developed by EPA was used to summarize the cumulative upstream catchment of each station for primary landuse characteristics, based on the National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 geospatial framework. The land use and land cover raster (NLCD 2011) can be viewed as an option in the station locations map above.

## Seasonal Kendall Trend Analysis

For all monitoring stations with sufficient data (8 years or more), trending was performed using Seasonal kendall trend analysis. Results are summarized in table (If no table is visible, there were no monitoring station that contained sufficient data to assess trends).


<!-- Output for the Seasonal kendall analysis, which was performed on data that had at least 8 years of data between 2000 and 2017. Only stations used in this analysis are included in this table. The values in the N column represent the number of results for each analyte at each monitoring station and includes duplicate values; the slope refers to the slope of the trend line; the p-value represents the statistical significance of the trend (p<0.8 is significant and is defined in the 'significant' column); median represents the median value of all assessed results for each station at each monitoring station.   -->

<!-- Total Phosphorus TMDL Loading Capacity Evaluation -->
<!-- The 2001/2012 Tualatin River Subbasin TMDL loading capacity values were applied to total phosphorus results within the Tualatin River Subbasin. The loading capacity (or TMDL target) defines the total amount of pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. This definition includes both natural and human sources. The loading capacity is defined as a summer (June - September) median. Boxplots are presented to show the summer distribution of total phosphorus as well as the median and how it compares to the loading capacity target ([Tualatin Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) and Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)](http://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/tmdlwqmp.pdf]) . -->

# Summary 

<!-- ![](T:/AgWQM/DataAnalysis/Middle Willamette/Figures/WQassessment_MiddleWillamette_01232018.png) -->
Summary of stations that fit the criteria for status and trend analysis. One or more exceedances within the last two years of available data defined whether a station was 'Meeting' or 'Not Meeting'. Trend was determined by significant trends associated with long-term datasets.
